[exp1.temp|1]: Skin temperature refers to the temperature of the skin of the subject's body. The skin temperature of different parts is different and is significantly affected by environment, physiological conditions, etc. \nThe skin temperature measured by this device is the comprehensive body skin temperature estimated from the local skin surface temperature in contact with the built-in sensor of the watch. The measurement range is 34-42℃. \nPlease note that this product is not a medical device. The measurement results are for reference only and are not for medical purposes. 
[exp1_n60.temp|1]: Skin temperature refers to the temperature of the skin of the subject's body. The skin temperature of various parts of the human body is different and is significantly affected by the environment, physiological conditions, etc. \nThe skin temperature measured by this device is the comprehensive body skin temperature estimated from the local skin surface temperature in contact with the built-in sensor of the watch. The measurement range is 34-42℃. \nPlease note that the measurement results of this product are for reference only and are not for medical purposes. 
[exp2.temp|1]: The watch relies on the temperature detection sensor to collect temperature. Factors such as the length of time the device is worn and the ambient temperature will affect the accuracy of the data. Please refer to the following precautions for correct use to help reduce errors:\n 1 . Make sure to wear this device for more than 10 minutes. \n 2. Try to measure at room temperature (around 25℃). \n 3. Please keep the watch and wrist dry. If there is sweat or water stains, please wipe them dry first. \n 4. Using high-power applications and charging may cause the watch body to heat up. Please wait until the watch body returns to normal temperature before taking measurements. 
[exp_desc1.vitality|1]: Vitality score measures the positive impact of physical activity on health. You're exercising at a level that will lead to significant health benefits when the cumulative Vitality score of the last 7 days reaches 100.
[exp_desc2.vitality|1]: The vitality score is based on the WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour, which recommend that:\nAll healthy adults engage in at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75-150 minutes of high-intensity exercise per week; or an equivalent combination of moderate and higher-intensity exercise.\nAt the same time, a little physical exercise is better than none. Replacing sedentary time with low-intensity exercise also has health benefits.
